            <text>Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path</text>
            <link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm</link>
            <answer>Choose the outgoing edge with the least total path cost, starting with a zero-cost edge to the start vertex. Look at the edge's destination vertex and store the total path costs (and, optionally, the predecessor) for each outgoing edge's vertex. Repeat until we reach the destination. Use, and update, a min heap (priority queue) to choose the outgoing edge with the lowest total cost.</answer>
            <note>This is usually implemented with a priority queue (heap) or, even better, a Fibonacci heap. This is like Prim's MST algorithm, but the relax step chooses the shortest path from the source, instead of the shortest edge from the tree. Use the inverse comparison to get the longest path.</note>

            <answer>Start with 0 cost for the source vertex, and infinity for all other vertices. Then, for each vertex, examine each edge, to calculate the total path cost (or infinity) to reach the adjacent vertices, reducing the stored cost if it is less. Repeat the examination of edges, and the recalculation, n-1 times, or until there is no change. Do 1 extra iteration to detect negative cycles.</answer>

            <answer>Add one vertex to the graph, with zero-length edges to every other vertex. Run Bellman-Ford to get the shortest path from the new vertex to every other. Reweight the original graph's edges by adding the difference of the edge's start and end vertices' paths from s.

            <answer>Depth First Search to order vertices by their completion time, starting from each still unexplored vertex. Then reverse that order.</answer>
            <note>This is only possible on DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs). So there can't be a topological sort if the graph is undirected, or if the graph has a cycle. Find a cycle by checking for adjacent nodes that we have not completed (completed all children) with but are still exploring (still in the stack).</note>
